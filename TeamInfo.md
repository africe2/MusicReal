## Project Summary

MusicReal is an application that allows users to post the current song they are listening to at a random given moment and see/listen to their friends’ song as well. If a user is not listening to a song at the random given moment, they can provide a song recommendation instead. Additionally, you can see a user’s song listening history on their profile.
